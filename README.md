## React Admin Scaffolding

Boilerplate for React & Redux web-app for managing an e-commerce or creative marketing site.

### Developing
`yarn start` start a live reload server with Webpack <br/>
`yarn build` build an app bundle with Webpack

App theme configured with styled-components.  Default-theme use of material-ui@next components.  Disabled use of themeToggle until I've secured functional use of material-ui themes.

Need to configure routes with redux-router.
